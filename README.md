**Fourth Year (2023/2024) Natural Language Processing Module - 65%**

Devising and implementing two fake news detector models. One with machine learning (random forest classification) and one with deep learning (LSTMs), to compare their performance with TF-IDF and BERT to see how feature extraction methods affect their accuracy.
